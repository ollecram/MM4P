    "I think this example is not appropriate to motivate the definition of *conditional probability* as it is finally presented by equation 23.9.\n",
    "The example starts by introducing $P(A, B)$ &ndash; to be read \"A *then* B\" &ndash; presumably with the intent to provide an intuitive interpretation of $P(B|A)$ which is then implicitly defined in 23.6 in terms of the former by asserting \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A, B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B|A) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is confusing because it induces the reader to assume a causal and/or temporal dependency between the event $A$ and the event $B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is totally unnecessary. Indeed, probability is associated to *outcomes* of a *sample space* $S$, then logically extended to any *event* (any subset of $S$  is an event). Since $A \\cap B$ &ndash; given any two events $A$ and $B$ in $S$ &ndash; is an event, there is no logical difficulty in talking of the probability $P(A \\cap B)$ of $A \\cap B$, the main *ingredient* of the conventional definition, namely \n",

    "\n",
    "When staring at the above definition, most people should have no problem understanding the numerator term of the right hand side, while getting an understanding of the scaling factor $P(A)$ in the denominator could take more time. I have found the most satisfying motivation for the above definition in the book *Introduction to Probability* by Grinstead and Snell. Here is what they say (see Example 4.3 in chapter 4):\n",
    "\n",
    "**In these examples we assigned a distribution function and then were given new\n",
    "information that determined a new sample space, consisting of the outcomes that\n",
    "are still possible, and caused us to assign a new distribution function to this space.\n",
    "We want to make formal the procedure carried out in these examples. Let\n",
    "$\\Omega = \\{\\omega_1, \\omega_2, . . . , \\omega_r\\}$ be the original sample space with distribution function \n",
    "$m(\\omega_j)$ assigned. Suppose we learn that the event E has occurred. We want to assign a new\n",
    "distribution function $m(\\omega_j|E)$ to $\\Omega$ to reflect this fact. \n",
    "Clearly, if a sample point $\\omega_j$ is not in E, we want $m(\\omega_j|E) = 0$. \n",
    "Moreover, in the absence of information to the contrary, it is reasonable to assume that \n",
    "the probabilities for $\\omega_k$ in $E$ should have the same relative magnitudes that they had before \n",
    "we learned that $E$ had occurred.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the numerator $P(B \\cap A)$ is the probability of the event $B \\cap A$ within the **original** sample space $S$. The denominator $P(A)$ scales that value to make it the probability of $B \\cap A$ within the **new** sample space &ndash; $S \\cap A$ &ndash; that must be adopted once it is known that $A$ has occurred.   \n"
